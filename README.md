This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to accessing non-existent attributes using the getAttribute() method. The bug occurs when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on an HTML element. While the method returns null which is expected, it can sometimes lead to problems if not handled carefully. In this example, we access a non-existent attribute 'nonExistent' and log the result. The solution involves checking if the attribute exists before accessing it, using hasAttribute().
